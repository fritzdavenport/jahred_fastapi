# FastAPI + ngrok
## FastAPI
I guess it makes an API. Quickly. Or something.

## ngrok
Takes something running locally and gives you a web address for it, normally something like
```text
https://big-long-string-ip1234.ngrok.io/
```
so you can use your API

## Setup
get a `.env` file which the `*.sh` scripts use for configuration
run the `*.sh` scripts to do what they say on the tin.
